    <p>Happy Text</p><p>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. There we are. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Don't
        kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.</p><p>There comes a nice little fluffer. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one
            stroke with an almighty brush. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Imagination is the key to painting. Let's go up in here, and
            start having some fun.</p><P>Get tough with it, get strong. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. There he comes. Learn when to stop. How do you make a round circle with
                a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</P>
